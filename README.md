### ***Description***
#### The Snake Game is played on a rectangular board where the snake moves automatically in one of four directions. The player controls the snake‚Äôs direction (up, down, left, right). A food item (represented as a circle) appears randomly on the board. When the snake eats the food, it grows longer and the score increases. The game ends if the snake collides with the board boundaries or with its own body.
#### Each time the snake eats the food:
* The snake grows longer.
* The player‚Äôs score increases.
#### The game ends when:
* The snake collides with the board boundaries.
* The snake collides with its own body.

#### The challenge is to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score! ####
