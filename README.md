### ***Description***
#### The Snake Game is played on a rectangular board where the snake moves automatically in one of four directions. The player controls the snakeâ€™s direction (up, down, left, right). A food item (represented as a circle) appears randomly on the board. When the snake eats the food, it grows longer and the score increases. The game ends if the snake collides with the board boundaries or with its own body. The player wins if the snake grows long enough to fill the entire board. ####
